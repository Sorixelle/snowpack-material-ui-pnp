# Snowpack + Material-UI Demo

This repo contains an example demonstrating an issue with production builds
repating to Yarn PnP and Material-UI.

To run this demo, simply run `yarn build` (no need to install, this repo uses
zero-installs Yarn 2). Notice how the build fails with "Module could not be
resolved by Snowpack (Is it installed?)." errors relating to Material-UI and
react-dom.
